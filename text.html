	       I have recently started a part time job in a bar where I work till 2 or 3 in the morning and I rarely know what day it is.. but yeah it's all great. I'm sort of an Nintendo nerd and do love alot of TV shows and movies, but mostly I'm a happy guy that loves my family, hanging out with friends, mountains of gorgeous food but also great design. </p>

            <p>A little history. I went to school at Saint columb's College in Derry. It was there that I realised all I wanted to do was to work in the Art and Design feild. At the time I tried to picture myself as a painter or a fine art student but I could never really see it. It was just I had no idea what I really wanted to do and the whole thought of the "Big Bad World" with its endless possibliltys was slightly scary at least. So with a little research and guidence from school teachers and foundation art year I wound up here .</p>
